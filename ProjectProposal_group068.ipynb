    "The Technical University of Denmark did a study measuring how long it took for certain topics to become popular, remain popular, and fade in various platforms. This study focussed on topics that became trending and then quickly left peoples radar. Professor Sune suggested \"It seems that the allocated attention time in our collective minds has a certain size but the cultural items competing for that attention have become more densely packed.\" In other words, peoples attention span is limited as long as the incoming information continues to grow. In addition, people may find less \"merit\" in focusing on old topics when they can gain more \"merit\" by indulging in new topics. Since people enjoy \"newness\" and a shorter time span, the amount of time spent on each topic tends to decrease. The results of the study seem to suggest that people are likely to prefer shorter videos as they want to constantly switch to new and \"intriguing\" videos instead of watching something long.  \n",

  {
   "source": [
    "The ideal dataset would contain:\n",
    "- Variables: `[\"video_duration\", \"year\", \"statistics\"]`\n",
    "- Observations: At least a 100 observations per year or day ([YouTubeâ€™s `videos` API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/videos/list) gives 200 at maximum per day)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Platforms\n",
    "## YouTube\n",
    "For YouTube, data collection will last at least 30 days, assuming that YouTube updates its \"most popular\" chart (`chart=mostPopular`) every 12 hours. By the end of the collection we expect to have at least `30 * 100 = 3000` observations (again, for YouTube) in our dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "One interesting thing to note is that YouTube's \"most popular\" ranking isn't in direct correlation with view counts. As a matter of fact, none of the \"viral\" videos (e.g. [dQw4w9WgXcQ](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ), [\"yee\"](https://youtu.be/q6EoRBvdVPQ), [Despacito](https://www.youtu.be/kJQP7kiw5Fk)) that we know of are in the dataset provided by YouTube. This poses challenges to our data collection process, because we aren't entirely sure what criteria need to be met for a video to be on the \"chart.\" \n",
